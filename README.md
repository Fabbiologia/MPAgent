## üìö Project Overview

This project harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to analyze Management Plans of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Spanish. The AI extracts critical information from uploaded documents, evaluates regulatory quality, assesses conservation objectives, and analyzes the relevance of cited literature to those objectives.

## üéØ Key Objectives

Our AI-driven tool accomplishes the following:

* üìã **Extract and summarize** zonation schemes and associated regulations
* üîç **Identify and clearly articulate** conservation objectives
* üìö **Collect and organize** cited literature in a structured format
* ‚öñÔ∏è **Assess protection quality** using the MPA Guide framework
* üìä **Evaluate conservation objectives** using SMART criteria and feasibility metrics
* üîó **Analyze congruence** between stated objectives and themes in cited literature

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project employs a modular, prompt-driven pipeline leveraging OpenAI's GPT API, supported by fully open-source frameworks for document processing and data management.

### üíª Tech Stack

* **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT API (with Spanish language support)
* **Document Processing**: LangChain, Ollama, and PyMuPDF
* **Data Management**: SQLite or PostgreSQL (optional)
* **Web Interface**: Streamlit (interactive UI)
